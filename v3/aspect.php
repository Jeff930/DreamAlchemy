              <p class="text-break">If you are not familiar with astrology, you’ll only see it as a one-way subject. But if you know better, you’ll be familiar with the different aspects that are to be considered to come up with the most efficient and accurate reading. </p>
              <p class="text-break">Astrology comes in varying aspects. Each has a certain influence that will deliver a significant result. Astrology isn’t just about sun signs. Four astrology aspects are also influential in determining results namely:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The planets</li>
                <li>The houses</li>
                <li>The sun signs </li>
                <li>The moon signs</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-break">Let’s take a look at each of them closer</p>
                <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>The Planets</strong></h5></p>
                <p class="text-break">Astrology and planets work hand in hand. When you study astrology, you will deal with ten planets excluding Earth. Earth is not counted because it is our point of perspective. Every planet has a different influence on the sun sign and the house it resides in based on the astrological chart.</p>
                <p class="text-break">Every planet has their own influences and representation. Depending on what they rule, they have a hold over the house and the sun sign. Here are some to name a few:  </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Saturn - signifies man’s limitations</li>
                <li>Jupiter - showcases prosperity and leadership</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-break">Another thing to consider about planets is their movements. Astrology relies high upon this. Various aspects of our lives are affected by the way the planets move and align. You will discover that conflict reigns in our lives during the times when Mars is in reverse. </p>
                <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>The Houses</strong></h5></p>
                <p class="text-break">Looking at the astrological chart or the Zodiac, you will see twelve houses. Each of the twelve houses signifies different aspects of human life. In astrology interpretation, houses are essential. They can represent your family, romance, or career. Wherever the house is placed, it will show what influence it can have on our life.</p>
               <p class="text-break">Remember that two houses will be vacant. The reason being having twelve houses but only ten planets. What the two vacant houses signify are the unimirant areas in your life. This can also mean that those areas are already successful in this life or another. It can also define that there are other areas in your life in need of your attention other than what the vacant houses represent.  </p>
               <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>The Sun Signs</strong></h5></p>
               <p class="text-break">If there is an aspect of astrology that most people are familiar with, it is the Zodiac sun signs. These are fairly simple given that they are based on a year's twelve months. An estimated twenty-eight days is ruling for every sun sign. </p>
                <p class="text-break">The sun signs are what we used in horoscopes. This are the following:</p>
                <ol>
                <li> Capricorn</li>
                <li> Sagittarius</li>
                <li> Aquarius</li>
                <li>Scorpio  </li>
                <li> Gemini</li>
                <li> Libra</li>
                <li> Leo</li>
                <li>Aries </li>
                <li> Virgo</li>
                <li> Cancer</li>
                <li> Taurus </li>
                <li> Pisces</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>The Moon Signs</strong></h5></p>
                <p class="text-break">In astrology interpretation, the moon has twelve signs. The twelve signs of the moon and the twelve signs of the sun are under the same name but do not usually meet.</p>
                <p class="text-break">Every Zodiac sign occurs in a similar sign of the moon once a month. This can stay for one to three days. The idea is that the moon’s twelve signs circle monthly, not yearly. A person’s mind certainly is at the highest level when the sun sign and the moon sign are similar. But if the moon sign is opposite that of the sun sign, conflicts arise.</p>
                <p class="text-break">There are moon phases that are not good for making decisions. This a pplies to all the sun signs. You need to be familiar with the emotions and energies that the moon holds because of the influence it holds over reading of the astrology aspects</p>
                <p class="text-break">Take note of all these astrology aspects. Make sure you have an experienced and expert astrologer to assist you in making decisions in your life as well as knowing predictions. Get to know more about astrology, visit [WEBSITE] today!</p>
