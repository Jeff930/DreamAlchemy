                        <p class="text-break">When it comes to viewpoints in life, the Eastern and the Western world clashes. The Eastern world is more esoteric while the Western world is more materialistic. These two worlds may be opposing in what they believe, but there comes a point where they meet - astrology. </p>
                        <p class="text-break">The Western world has a more advanced economy. And because they are more developed, they do not easily believe in things unless there is scientific proof or explanation to it. The westerners are more taken with things of material value, unlike their eastern counterparts who value love, emotions, and affection among others.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">The lifestyle of the westerners is more open compared to easterners. Easterners lie Indians are more religious and can't think of life without thinking about God. Westerners, on the other hand, are more scattered in their beliefs. This is proven with the presence of many Atheists and Agnostics. Although westerners are open in thinking, they still search for scientific explanations for everything.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Life is not all about science. There are things that science cannot explain. These things we leave to God to explain. Just because it is not proven doesn't mean it isn’t true. Or just because we cannot see something, it still ain’t true. There is a point in life where answers are not clear or specific. You just have to trust in the process and everything will work out fine.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">And to provide solutions for in-betweens, we have astrology. Westerners are now more accepting of this possibility. We can see the balance in astrology as it delivers explanations of some things we do not understand. </p>
                        <p class="text-break">The Western world is used to a fast-paced lifestyle. They are accustomed to living life so busy that they forget about their health, fitness, and state of mind. They are slowly learning to adapt to the eastern lifestyle of medication and yoga among others. Life should not be all about earning or making money. People need to take care of themselves, too.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Besides this lifestyle change, westerners are also adapting the belief in astrology where it delivers help in predicting one’s future. The horoscope is a big player in the western world. It is amazing for them how planetary motions play key parts in telling predictions. Westerners are now becoming more open to understanding the opposite sex based n the zodiac signs they hold.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Astrology is a big mystery that westerners love to unfold. They want to know more about it. They seek astrology to help them with their love, life, career, relationships, health, and many others. Astrology may be fairly new in western world popularity but it is getting there, slowly but surely.
