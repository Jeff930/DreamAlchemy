                        <p class="text-break pt-3">Humans look up to the planets and the stars before making big decisions in life. That was the practice before. Astrology is one of the oldest sciences there is. The sun, moon, stars, and planets all come into play with our life situations. So, what are the effects of astrology in our lives?</p>
                    <p class="text-break">Astrology is a guide by the principle of planetary motions. Most of us are familiar with the Zodiac Sign horoscope or the sun sign. We know too well that we follow them in the newspaper then, and now online. What we read from our horoscopes are taken as guides to help us in our lives. We believe in what we read that in a way, it moves us towards achieving what is written.  </p>
                    <p class="text-break">
                    Astrology via horoscopes allows a person to foresee the future. This gives a person the time to get ready for what is coming. We see astrology as a reference. If we want answers in different aspects of our lives, we refer to astrology. Astrology can give us answers about our life, career, relationships, finances, health, and many more. Yes, life is hard as it is but having astrology helps us understand better. It helps us be more overcoming of the situations as we anticipate them. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-break">Astrology is very effective in allowing people to better know themselves. It helps them see their strengths and weaknesses. It allows them to use their strengths to move further and their weaknesses as motivation to turn it all around. We can learn about astrology. It helps us see more clearly. It helps us be hopeful and positive. Astrology guides individuals to battle life more confidently as it happens.</p>
                <p class="text-break">Astrology believes that we cannot change our destiny but we can do remedies for it. So if a certain event is about to happen, we cannot remove it from a person’s life. However, we can improve how we react to it. This is the purpose of astrology. It prepares us and it helps us deal better with life situations that would otherwise break us automatically. It is always better to be ready and that’s what astrology is good for. It gives us the upper hand in dealing with the most unfavorable occurrences in our lives. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-break">Astrology can tell us what is good for our lives. When we know, we can decide to put more effort into actions that will give us good rewards. It helps us to be more invested in more important things. Instead of wasting time on something that won’t mean anything, astrology points us in the direction where our time and energy will be more valuable and worth it. 
                </p>

                <p class="text-break">There are a lot of things astrology is good for - love, marriage, health; you name it. Astrology helps us cope during tough times. If we are to fall in love, it can help us decide who will be a perfect catch for us. In terms of health, it shows us what diseases we are prone to. If we want to be better, we can take preventative measures to improve our health. There is always a workaround for everything when we refer to astrology.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-break">
                    Astrology has practical applications. You can understand yourself and another person based on their Zodiac signs. It gives you more insight into how they are as people. This will also help you build the relationships that work. And then there will be days when you feel so down all of a sudden. It’s not just because of you. It can be because the Moon is Void of Course. Knowing this information via astrology will help you be ready and understand what is happening. It can also help you adjust more comfortably. Instead of forming disagreement and miscommunication with others, you can be proactive and stay away to prevent all these.  
                </p>
                <p class="text-break">Astrology can also work better than counseling. Counseling takes time and slow in process. Astrology can give you the reasons you are looking for. It is written in the stars and the planets, how else can it go wrong? Plus, astrology can predict your future, too.
