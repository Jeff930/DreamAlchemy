                        <p class="text-break">There is a divided belief when it comes to astrology. Some say it is a science while others believe it is not. Some believe astrology is not accurate while others use it as their guide in their daily life. You see, there are varying ways people see astrology. Whatever your belief may be, it is essential to get to know some of the top astrology terms. Here they are:</p>
                        <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>Sun Sign</strong></h5></p>
                        <p class="text-break">When dealing with astrology, the starting point will be your sun sign. There are twelve sun signs. They are also called the Zodiac signs. This is the constellation passed by the sun when you were born. </p>
                        <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>Horoscope</strong></h5></p>
                        <p class="text-break">If there is one thing people are familiar with in astrology, it will be the horoscope. We think of it as the advice we read in the newspaper (then) and online. Contrary to common belief, there is more to horoscope than merely giving love and life advice and lucky numbers. It is actually a complete planet map. It deals with constellations and planets altogether.</p>
                        <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>Aspects</strong></h5></p>
                        <p class="text-break">The measurement you get when you draw lines between the planets is called an aspect. Two aspects you need to be familiar with are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Conjunction - measures very small and is less than te degrees</li>
                        <li>Opposition - measure very big and is nearly 180 degrees</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>Houses</strong></h5></p>
                        <p class="text-break">This is similar to the Zodiac signs. They deal with varying aspects of every person’s life such as health, career, finances, and many others. </p>
                        <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>Retrograde</strong></h5></p>
                        <p class="text-break">There are many planets in the solar system. Every planet circles the sun. And each of these planets moves at different speeds. Mercury being close to the sun only requires a matter of weeks to circle it out. Pluto, on the other hand, takes centuries to orbit the sun.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">The earth also passes the planets and it may seem like it moving backward, that’s what we call retrograde. This is an optical illusion that displays backward motion in action and the horoscope.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Astrology is a broad study. But to get you started, it is important to keep these terms in mind. Get familiar with the above terms to easily understand astrology. If you love astrology and would like to learn more about it, please check out [WEBSITE].</p>
