                 <p class="text-break">The first sign in the ZOdiac is Aries the Ram if you were born from March w21 to April 20, then you are an Arain. January signals the start of the New Year. but in the Zodiac year, the Spring equinox of March 21 is the start. After all, spring signifies rebirth and renewal. </p>

<p class="text-break">  One famous person under the Aries sign is Leonardo da Vinci. When you are an Arian, you are compared to a young ram. Arians are very adventurous, energetic, and a little bit of a daredevil. You always want to do things differently. Arians want something else and something unique. Other popular people under the Aries sign are:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Thomas Jefferson </li>
        <li>Booker T. Washington</li>
        <li>Francis Ford Coppola</li>
        <li>Jane Goodall </li>
        <li>Marlon Brando</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="text-break">Looking at the list of Arian above, you will notice that these people were never afraid to stand out. They are people who represent their chosen field. They are the ones who made significant differences in the world.  </p>
    <p class="text-break">Arians love to take action and explore. They are intense as friends and passionate as lovers. They tend to be too much at times that this character drives people away. Arians will work out with people who can catch the same intensity and fire without causing a collision. </p>
    <p class="text-break">But Arians are not all fire and passion. They too have a sensitive side. They can be lamb-like and soft. It is critical as an Arian to let this softer side dominate at times, too. With regard to work, Arians are more of an idea creator. Sometimes, this can be a problem as Arians to begin but not finish jobs. To balance everything out, go, and work with people who can complement and finish up with the ideas you have.</p>
    <p class="text-break">The key is in the balance. Discover your strengths and weaknesses as an Arian and supplement your power with the help of others. Find out more about astrology, horoscope, and zodiac signs by visiting [WEBSITE].</p>
