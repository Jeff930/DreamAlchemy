                        <p class= "pt-3 text-break"> Dreaming is a common encounter for a person while sleeping. When we sleep, that is when our thoughts come to life. We sleep, but our brains are still active. When we dream, it is as if it is real. Not all dreams are the same, but we experience almost similar themes. What are our dreams telling us? Isn’t it wonderful if we can get an explanation for every dream we have?</p>

                            <b>Here are 7 of the most common dreams and their meanings:</b>
                        </h3>
                        <h3>Flying</h3>
                        <p class="text-break text-left">
                        We all have that wish of being a superhero. We have imagined ourselves flying and soaring up in the sky. But to actually feel like it’s real in a dream is different. What can it be about? When you see yourself fly in your dreams, it talks about freedom and independence. It can also mean you want to have a bird’s eye view of the world. Flying in your dreams can also suggest caution. You need to be careful because if you fly too high, you might risk falling badly.  
                        </p>
                        <h3>Losing a Tooth or Teeth</h3>
                        <p class="text-break">Dreams about your teeth rotting or falling off can signify the anxieties you are feeling. You may feel concerned about how other people see you and you start to worry. Having this kind of dream may come from the fear of getting rejected, being embarrassed, or simply not feeling confident about yourself. Losing teeth in your dreams can also mean that you find it difficult to communicate or talk to others. </p>
                        <h3>Falling</h3>
                        <p class="text-break">
                        Dreams about falling can be two different things. There is a type of fall where it’s like sudden and taking the plunge. This kind of dream talks about the loss of control. It signals that you need to start to be more conscious. Then, there's falling in slow motion. This, on the other hand, shows that you are relaxing your stress, fears, and anxieties. You are finally letting go of the things that you can’t control. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Death</h3>
                        <p class="text-break">Dreaming of dying or dead people suggests something about yourself. Death means the end. It can also show the need to move on with a new one. When you dream about a person dying, consider what that person means to you. That is a representation of what you are losing or what’s going to end. It also signifies something new that's about to begin. </p>
                        <h3>Being Naked</h3>
                        <p class="text-break">One of the most uncomfortable dreams to be in is dreaming you are naked. When you dream of being naked, it signifies your insecurities. It can also be about being ashamed, vulnerable, or humiliated. When we dream about being nude, it sends a message that we may be waiting to be more liberated. We want more freedom. We want to break free from the things that keep us locked and chained. </p>
                        <h3>Having Sex</h3>
                        <p class="text-break">Dreaming of having sex with someone shows that you may be having secret desires for that person. But it doesn't always work that way. Having sex with someone in your dreams can also mean that your sexual partner in the dream has certain qualities that you want to have. You want to integrate the quality of that person into your own persona. </p>
                        <h3>Traveling</h3>
                        <p class="text-break">Dreams about traveling suggest going somewhere. Where you travel, how you travel, and how ready you are when you travel are all essential in defining the true meaning of your travel dream. You have to analyze the dream more comprehensively to help you distinguish the parry of yourself or your life that you will travel to and the reason behind it. When you dream about traveling, it talks about the journey and looking at your life’s purpose in a different light. </p>
                        <p class="text-break">Getting familiar with what our dream means can aid in solving problems dealing with our thoughts or emotions. Interpreting dreams can deliver concepts that can help us see and understand more about ourselves.
