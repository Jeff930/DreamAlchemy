                        <p class="text-break">Times are changing. Even the things we used to do then are not what we do today. Astrology used to be the accepted science when dealing with symptoms and medical diagnosis but all of that has changed. What used to be an accepted practice has now been disregarded. Is it because we’ve evolved or we’re too advanced for the universe? Astrology, medicine, and astronomy - what is all behind it?</p>
                        <p class="text-break">We used to live in harmony with the stars. We look up to the sky to make decisions in our life. We consult the planets and the stars to tell us more about our health. But thing’s changed. Maybe we were too stubborn. We never truly understood how the universe works. And so we focused on what the Western civilization can do - to conquer. </p>
                        <p class="text-break">Looking back, astrology mattered. It is how astronomy developed. If we want to know about war, diseases, famine, weather, and many others; there are tablets. Babylonians were first to assemble tablets in the position of Venus to tell us about these things.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">And then, there’s the Tetrabiblos that Claudius Ptolemy made. We highly relied on astrology to tell us about love, relationships, careers, and others. We believed in it so good that we followed it to the tee in making life decisions. Astrological charts are so integral that we can see the n in the Roman times and as part of diagnostic processes.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Olden practices refer to the Zodiac. We can confirm this with their practice of bloodletting. They believed that each Zodiac sign rules a human body part. Pisces is for the feet, Sagittarius for the thighs, and so on. They believed attracting the moon can cause too much bleeding so when the moon was in the zodiac ruling a certain body part, that part is to be avoided during bloodletting.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Astrology is a big part of medical manuscripts and almanacs. The power of the moon is so essential that people refer to the “Zodiac Man” figure for the influences of the moon. We also use the phases of the moon for almanacs.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Astrology, medicine, and astronomy are interconnected in many ways than we know. Times and practices might have changed but no one can deny the big influence astrology had on science and human life.
