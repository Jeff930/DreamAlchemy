               <p class="text-break">When you say astrology, the first thing that comes to mind is the sun. Many people miss out on another important element in astrology. We forget about the moon. The sun may be of more popularity bit the moon also plays a vital role in the study of astrology. </p>
               <p class="text-break">We are familiar with the zodiac signs and horoscopes because of the Western view of astrology. But there is also the Eastern world view. In India and China, the moon is a big part of astrological studies. It is used as a part of daily life to tell time to do activities. It may seem hard to believe but Easter astrology can deliver more accurate results compared to its Western counterpart.</p>
               <p class="text-break">Astrology is a big picture. There are sun signs and planetary movements. All of these are influenced by the phases and positions that the moon holds. The moon affects the overall picture in astrology. Whatever the results may be from the planetary alignments to the sun signs, everything can differ depending on the moon.</p>
               <p class="text-break">The moon is very influential in the outcome of astronomical phenomena and Zodiac predictions. The moon affects our emotions. So if a certain prediction is given via astrological phenomena, it can still change depending on the phases of the moon and the emotions it embodies. Even the effect of planetary alignments to the zodiac sun signs changes during certain phases of the moon. So here, you can see how valuable the moon is setting accurate predictions. </p>
               <p class="text-break">Because of the importance of the moon in astrology, the influence of the moon on the Zodiac is a study in itself. You can come up with the best decisions when you are aware of the essential information you need. These are the sun sign, moon cycles, and moon signs. The Zodiac and the moon signs share the same name but they donâ€™t coincide.</p>
               <p class="text-break">These are some of the things you need to know about the moon:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Moon signs cycle monthly not yearly</li>
                <li>Ever moon sign comes in three phases</li>
                <li>The three phases of the moon are - ascending, true, and descending</li>

                <li>Our emotions are affected by the phases of the moon and other astrology aspects</li>

                <p class="text-break">Knowledge is always power. Being familiar with the above information can help us be more mindful of astrological results. When we know when we are most vulnerable, we can prevent making major decisions in our life. The moon holds facts about our emotions. Keep that in mind to ensure no regrets ensue afterward.</p>
