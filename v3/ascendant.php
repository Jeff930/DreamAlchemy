                <p class="text-break">You can discover what you need and what drives you by knowing your moon and sun sign. But in astrology, there are a lot of elements to consider. There is also your ascendant sign or rising sign. This is the Zodiac sign that is rising on the Eastern horizon when you were born. Read on to discover what you need to know about your ascendant sign.</p>
                <p class="text-break">There is no questioning the power that the sun and the moon signs hold. But your ascending sign or rising sign also influences your life. To tell your accurate rising sign, you have to define your exact birth time. For your information, you can find your rising sign on your astrological chart’s first house edge at the nine o’clock position.</p>
                <p class="text-break">Different signs tell various aspects of yourself. You can look at them in this way:</p>
                <ul>
                <li> Sun sign - signifies your soul, inner personality, and potential</li>
                <li> Moon sign - a symbol of your heart and is your emotional element</li>
                <li> Rising sun - represents your physical self and face towards the world</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-break">You are all different sorts of Zodiac signs rolled into one. Even if you are a Taurus in Sun sign, you can also be a Gemini in your rising sign. This explains the differences in your personality. You can be laid back but still energetic and witty</p>
                <p class="text-break">There are aspects of yourself that you are not comfortable sharing with others. Rising signs work like masks. When you check on your ascendant sign, you will see the definition of your behavior, manners, and personality that the general public sees. And even when you share the same birthday as others, you will still see opposing aspects of your personalities and experiences.</p>
                <p class="text-break">You might notice that the Ascendant sign and rising sign are interchangeable. Well, it’s because they are the same. The literal meaning is that this is the sign rising on the Eastern horizon of the sky at the time you were born and in the place you were born in. The best way to get a complete and valid Natal Chart is by having both your birthplace and birth time</p>
                <p class="text-break">The more accurate your information is, the more accurate your results will be. Get to know your ascendant sign and rising sign to understand yourself and others better. For more information about astrology, check out [WEBSITE].</p>
