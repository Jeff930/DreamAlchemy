                 <p class="text-break">We’ve all heard about astrology before. But regardless of how popular this word is, it still helps to get the meaning of astrology straight from the experts. If you want to get familiar with astrology even more, read on. </p>
                <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>  Defining Astrology  </strong></h5></p>
                <p class="text-break">By definition, astrology is the study of the position of the planets as a way of defining the path that awaits a person's life, events, future related to karma, or past life. Unknown to many, astrology has been around for ages. It was in the 3rd millennium BC when the earliest sign and recording of astrology was found. Astrology is more dominant than we know. It is actually influential in culture, early astronomy, and other disciplines</p>
                <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>  Astrology in Future Prediction  </strong></h5></p>
                <p class="text-break">Astrology is known to predict a person’s future. There are two ways to do that. One is through astrological transits. The second is via astrological progressions.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Astrological transits - the study of the planet’s movements and the effects of having those movements in space and personal horoscopes. 
</li>
                <li>Astrological progression - the use of methods to define how a horoscope has moved ahead in time. </li>
                
                </ol>
                <p class="text-break">Knowing both of these allows for better future prediction. At present, actual events are no longer predicted by astrologers. What they do is to provide different general astrological events to deliver improved results and define the value of irrational situations in a person’s life.</p>
                <p class="text-break"><h5><strong> The Three Main Astrological Traditions </strong></h5></p>
                <p class="text-break">There are many things you need to know about astrology. To be acquainted with this study, you also have to get familiar with the three main astrological traditions namely:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Vedic Astrology - Uses the astrological chart and the horoscope along with the sun, moon, and planet’s position to make predictions. It also links zodiac signs to their original constellations. It predicts the future through the use of lunar mansions or nakshatras and doshas or planetary periods.</li>
                <li>Western Astrology - It also uses the horoscope and the astrological sign. To predict the future, the position of the moon, sun, and planets are considered.</li>
                <li>Chinese Astrology - this method is used not only in China but in many countries in Asia. It divides the zodiac signs depending on the celestial equator. A zodiac sign is equivalent to a year it is then added to a system using Chinese cosmology (five elements). The result will be a 60 (12 x 5) cycle in a year.  </li>

                </ol>
                <p class="text-break">I know you are wondering, “Can astrology predict the future?” There are many believers in astrology but there are also doubters. But to answer the question, astrology can predict the future to a certain degree. It is after all a science that takes considerable study to define a prediction.</p>
                <p class="text-break">To make astrology as accurate as possible, correct information and exert calculations are essential.
