                        <p class="text-break">The future is yet to come yet all of us can’t wait to see what awaits us there. The view of the future is always something anybody wants a bit of. People are born curious and it is this curiosity that leads us to venture to distances to know more about things that are to come. </p>
                        <p class="text-break">Popular because it can tell us a lot about things we do not know. Be it the oast, present, or the future, astrology has a say on it. No matter how we want to believe in some things, we should also be open to possible errors. Nothing is exact or precise when it comes to predictions and foretelling. There are different strategies and practices, therefore you can also expect various results. Sometimes, it is not about how trained and skilled an astrologer is, it can be on the proficiency of the practitioner in their practice.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Remember that there are different types and forms of astrology. There is Chinese and Indian astrology. You will see differences in their approaches but the ending all goes to telling what the future holds.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Here are some of the things a skilled astrologer can do for you:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Tell you about your personality</li>
                        <li>Tell you the information you haven’t shared with anyone else</li>
                        <li>Provide future predictions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-break">Astrologers can draw conclusions about you by creating a birth chart. Through this, they will check the position of the stars on your birth date and compare it with the stars’ present standing to make predictions. Referring to the birth chart is very effective. Truth is, the use of birth charts is specifically mandatory in India before marriage to check on couple compatibility. </p>
                        <p class="text-break">This practice is not without controversy. People place malice on this act because of the Manglik theory. Astrologers check compatibility. In Indian astrology, there are houses and signs. When you find Mars rested in houses 1, 4, 7, 8, and 12 - that’s the Manglik. If a person is a Manglik, that person may not marry. </p>
                        <p class="text-break">Basically, all stars have characteristics and so do houses. Each house can be associated with varying aspects like money, health, relationships, and others. The combination of these two elements is the result of what astrologers forecast.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">Manglik people are under the effect of Mars. This means this person has the qualities of ego and self-respect. It is not good to have these qualities in specific houses as it can be brutal in relationships and marriage.</p>
