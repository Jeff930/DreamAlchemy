                       <p class="text-break">Is astrology real? You have heard this question a lot of times before yet the answer still remains unclear. Let me take you back in time to help you decide whether astrology is real or not. </p>
                       <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>Astrology is NOT the New Age’s Hocus Pocus</strong></h5></p>
                       <p class="text-break">Astrology has been around since the olden days. It has been practiced by the Babylonians since 1645 BC. Early men studied and tried to understand what was going on around their environment. Trying to discover how things work, what time is, what seasons are, how influenced we are by nature, the earth, and the environment all worked together and resulted in the study of astrology.</p>
                        <p class="text-break">There are four earthly elements in astrology. These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Wind</li>
                        <li>Earth</li>
                        <li>Air</li>
                        <li>Fire</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="text-break">These four elements are essential in astrology. The Zodiac stars are grouped under these four and are responsible for telling the compatibility of every star with others. </p>
                        <p class="text-break">There may be just a few things we know about astrology but astrology actually has a lot of arms. One of which is:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Natal astrology - an astrology form that focuses on a person and predicting events depending on what star the person is born unde</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="text-break">Astrology is the study of the planets and their positions in effect on a person’s personalities, traits, and characteristics depending on the person’s time of birth. </p>
                        <p class="txt-break">Astrologers are more elaborate than you can imagine. It takes practice, patience, skill, and a lot of understanding to be able to come up with an accurate natal chart. You have to give your astrologer these things first:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Exact birth time</li>
                        <li>Exact birthplace</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="text-break">This information may seem petty and simple but giving accurate details will give a better reading for you. </p>
                        <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>Astrology for Ancient Doctors</strong></h5></p>
                        <p class="text-break">Astrology is not just for telling your characteristics, traits, or personalities. Ancient doctors referred to astrology before. They are called medicine philosophers. These are people like Hipocatres. Hippocrates checked on his patient's astrological profile for a better understanding of their personality and used it for medicinal purposes. </p>
                        <p class="text-break"><h5><strong>Astrology is Gaining Popularity</strong></h5></p>
                        <p class="text-break">Today, you can find different resources and references for astrology. People are so interested in it that there are astrological websites, seminars, books, and newspapers dedicated to spreading astrology. We all want to know what happens next and these resources can lead us to that</p>
                        <p class="txt-break">Astrology comes in varying forms. When it comes to deductions, Chinese astrology uses the lunar calendar while Western astrology uses the solar calendar with both circling around a person and his personality. </p>
                        <p class="text-break">Astrology is becoming more and more acceptable and dominant in the world because people want to know more. Be it their future, career, or love life. They can’t seem to get enough. If you check on newspapers or online sites, you can find daily horoscope readings. And at each time, people flock to them.</p>
